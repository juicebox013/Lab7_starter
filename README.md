## Question 1
I would add the automated tests within the github actions page that would run whenever there is pull request. This is because it allows for both
you and the collaborators to see what is being changed and tested. In addition to this, if it passes all the tests, github will alert all 
team members that the code is safe to merge.

## Question 2
No you would not use end-to-end testing to check what a certain function outputs.

## Question 3
The main difference between the navigation mode and snapshot mode is that the navigation mode will analyze the page after it has been loaded, but will not pick up any changes that were made in the moment. On the other hand, if we were in snapshot mode, we could make changes to the page in real time without it needing to be loaded, and those changes would be picked up.

## Question 4
According to Lighthouse, three things that we could do to make the website better are : 1. Serve images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time, 2. Consider adding preconnect or dns-prefetch resource hints to establish early connections to important third-party origins, and 3. Minify JavaScript files to reduce payload sizes and script parse time.
